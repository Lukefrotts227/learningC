# Learning C
- Cataloguing as I learn the c programming language through a variety of sources and methods.
- Will transistion into C++ for all as well
- Goal to become adept in C/C++
- not all of the work in these languages will be done here
- furthermore the non-basic folders will often include learning c++ for these skills as well

# How is it going 
- The basics folder covers the general basics of c I will review.
- It is a combination of traditional and project-based learning.
- I am currently doing the Harvard cs50 course separately from this.
# What else
- folders beyond basic will include more specialized work or larger projects.
- The graphic folder has now been begun.
- The data structures folder has now begun
- The machine learning folder has been begun
- The c++ basics folder has begun
# The graphic folder 
- My learning of graphics programming in c.
- This folder will focus on this.
- might just do this in C++
# The data structures folder
- learn data sturctures in c 
# The machine learning folder 
- Machine learning in c
# C++ basic folder
- The same as the basics folder but for C++
